# LSTM_Networks
This is the code for "LSTM Networks - The Math of Intelligence (Week 8)" By Siraj Raval on Youtube

## Overview 

This is the code for [this](https://youtu.be/9zhrxE5PQgY) video on Youtube by Siraj Raval as part of the Math of Intelligence course. This is an LSTM (long
short term memory) network built using just numpy. LSTM's are an improvement to recurrent networks, able to remember 
long range dependencies. 

## Dependencies

* numpy

Install dependencies using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

## Usage

Type `jupyter notebook` into terminal and the code will pop up in your browser.

Install jupyter[here](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).
